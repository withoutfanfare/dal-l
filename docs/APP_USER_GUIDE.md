# Dalil User Guide

## What Dalil is for

Dalil is a desktop app for browsing and searching your engineering handbook and related documentation.

## Main areas

- Sidebar: handbook navigation tree.
- Top bar: search, navigation controls, tabs, bookmarks.
- Main content: current document.
- Right panel (document pages): table of contents, bookmarks, notes, highlights.

## Daily workflow

1. Open or switch project in the sidebar.
2. Choose a collection (if more than one is available).
3. Search with `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to jump to any page.
4. Keep key pages open in tabs.
5. Add bookmarks or notes for important sections.

## Keyboard shortcuts (most used)

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: Open search.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + \`: Toggle sidebar.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + [`: Back.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + ]`: Forward.
- `/`: Focus search.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + ?`: Show full keyboard shortcuts.

## Help in the app

Use the **Help** link in the sidebar footer to open the in-app help page at any time.

## Good practice

- Rebuild a project from the Projects page after major documentation updates.
- Use consistent titles and headings in source markdown for better search and chunk quality.
- Keep notes short and specific to the exact section you are reading.
